<p>Although Illinois has been nicknamed the &ldquo;Prairie
State,&rdquo; many parts of it are hilly and scenic. The idea of large
areas of the state being nothing more than broad, flat prairies
has come about because the major highways have been built
to take advantage of the comparatively low, gently rolling
landscape rather than the rougher more scenic areas.</p>
<p>Physiography is the study of the creation and gradual
change of land surface forms (the landscape). Thus, the land
surface as we see it today in each of the physiographic provinces
(<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>) has had a particular history of development.</p>
<p>Illinois is about 385 miles long from north to south and
about 218 miles wide. It has an area of 55,947 square miles.
The average elevation of the state is about 600 feet above
sea level. Charles Mound, however, in the northern part of
Jo Daviess County in extreme northwestern Illinois, has an
elevation of 1,241 feet above sea level and is the highest point
in the state.</p>
<p>Cheap water transportation is available to Illinois industry
through Lake Michigan, the Illinois Waterway, and the
Mississippi, Ohio, and Wabash Rivers. These major rivers
of Illinois collect the surface drainage of the state from a network
of about 500 streams.</p>
<h3 id="c1">WHAT IS THE EARTH MADE OF BENEATH THE GROUND SURFACE?</h3>
<p>The earth is made of a large number of different rocks
and minerals (limestone, sandstone, shale, coal, iron, granite,
and many others). These materials are divided into three
zones: core, mantle, and crust (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>).</p>

<dt>Mantle (1800 miles)</dt>
<dt>Outer core (1400 miles)</dt>
<dt>Inner core (750 miles)</dt></dl>
<h3 id="c2">WHAT IS CORE?</h3>
<p>The core is the innermost zone of the earth. It is mainly
iron with some nickel and cobalt. The inner core probably is solid,
but the outer core may consist of the same elements in a molten
form. The core is the most dense (heaviest) of the three zones.</p>
<h3 id="c3">HOW DOES THE MANTLE DIFFER FROM THE CORE?</h3>
<p>The mantle, which surrounds the core, is a rigid zone of
materials rich in iron and magnesium. These materials are not as
dense as those found in the core.</p>
<h3 id="c4">WHAT IS THE CRUST OF THE EARTH AND HOW IS IT DISTINGUISHED FROM THE MANTLE AND THE CORE?</h3>
<p>The crust, the top part of which includes the ground we
walk on, is the hard, outer surface layer of the earth. Although the
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
crust is about 6 to 30 miles deep, the scale (size) of <a href="#fig2">figure 2</a> allows
it to be drawn only as the thin outer line. The rocks and
minerals that we are all acquainted with are found in the crust.
These rocks are not as dense and do not have as high an iron content
as do the rocks of the mantle and the core.</p>
<h3 id="c5">WHAT IS THE EARTH&rsquo;S CRUST UNDER ILLINOIS MADE OF?</h3>
<p>The earth&rsquo;s crust under Illinois is made of: sedimentary
rocks deposited by water, wind, or glaciers (limestone, sandstone,
shale, glacial drift); igneous, or melted rocks (granite, gabbro);
and metamorphic, or altered sedimentary and igneous rocks (quartzite,
gneiss). These various types of rocks have a relatively thin
covering of broken or weathered material called mantle rock and
soil.</p>
<h3 id="c6">WHEN AND HOW WAS THE LAND SURFACE OF ILLINOIS FORMED?</h3>
<p>The ground surface over most of Illinois was formed during
the ice age (Quaternary Period) which lasted from about one
million years ago up to nearly 5,000 years ago. As much as 90
percent of the state was covered by one of several sheets of glacial
ice (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>). The glaciers smoothed down and covered much
of the old, rocky, hilly land surface and filled old valleys with
loose, unconsolidated deposits.</p>
<h3 id="c7">WHERE DID THE LOOSE, UNCONSOLIDATED DEPOSITS COME FROM AND WHAT ARE THEY MADE OF?</h3>
<p>In Canada vast thicknesses of snow and ice accumulated
until the weight of the ice finally caused it to flow slowly outward,
mainly to the south (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>). Rocks and surface materials of all
types were picked up and carried by the glaciers for great distances
before being deposited. Pieces of granite, quartzite, and native
copper among the many local rocks and minerals are found in glacial
deposits and indicate that at least part of these deposits came
from the Great Lakes Region. The materials deposited range from
clay-size minerals to large boulders.</p>

</div>
<p>Weathering and bacterial
decay action have modified
many of the loose, unconsolidated
surface materials into
soils. The present soils of Illinois
are fertile partly because
they have minerals and trace elements
(minute amounts of elements
such as copper, zinc,
manganese) brought in by the
glaciers from adjacent parts of
the country. The youngest and
most fertile soils occur in the
northeastern part of the state and
along the Illinois and Mississippi
River valleys. These young
soils are more fertile because the
glacial deposits and loess (wind-blown silt) upon which they have
developed are younger and fresher. The minerals and trace elements
in these deposits have not been dissolved out to the extent
that they have in the older glacial deposits and soils in other parts
of the state.</p>

<p>Scattered mammoth (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>) and mastodon remains have been

which is an accumulation of partially decomposed plant materials,
has been found, especially in the northern part of the state. It is
marketed as an organic soil conditioner.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">MINERAL WEALTH</span></h2>
<h3 id="c11">HOW WEALTHY IS ILLINOIS IN MINERAL PRODUCTION?</h3>
<p>In 1963, Illinois mineral production totaled approximately
$615,000,000. This placed the state first as a mineral producer
in the Upper Mississippi Valley and eighth in the nation.</p>
<h3 id="c12">WHAT MINERAL COMMODITIES ARE PRODUCED IN ILLINOIS?</h3>
<p>Coal and petroleum, two of the world&rsquo;s most important
mineral resources, are produced in Illinois. Iron ore, another
mineral of extreme importance, is brought into the steel mills of
the Chicago and East St. Louis areas from deposits in Minnesota
and Missouri. Some ore from foreign countries is also processed
in these mills.</p>
<p>A great variety of mineral commodities are produced in Illinois.
In the order of their 1963 value (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>) they are (1) crude
oil and natural gas, (2) coal, (3) clay products, (4) crushed stone
and cement, (5) common sand and gravel, (6) special sands,
(7) fluorspar, and (8) metals&mdash;zinc and lead.</p>
<h3 id="c13">HOW MANY ILLINOIS COUNTIES PRODUCE MINERAL COMMODITIES?</h3>
<p>In 1963, 99 of the 102 counties of Illinois reported mineral
production of one kind or another.</p>

<dt>Fluorspar and Metals  1.9%</dt></dl>
<h3 id="c14">HOW MANY PEOPLE WORK IN THE MINERAL INDUSTRIES OF ILLINOIS?</h3>
<p>In 1963, approximately 27,000 people worked in mines,
quarries, oil fields, and direct processing operations such as
cement and clay products plants and oil refineries. Many other
persons were employed in transporting the materials and in plants
and general offices.</p>
<h3 id="c15">HOW DOES THE FARMER IN ILLINOIS BENEFIT FROM MINERAL PRODUCTION?</h3>
<p>The farmers of the state are among those receiving direct
and indirect benefits from Illinois minerals. In 1963, more than
4,800,000 tons of agstone (crushed limestone and dolomite) were
spread on Illinois fields to reduce acidity, maintain soil fertility,
and improve crop production. Other stone and stone products are
used in constructing farm buildings and facilities and in the maintenance
of farm-to-market roads. In addition, petroleum products
and coal provide energy to power the laborsaving devices that enable
the farmer to increase his production and scale of operations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">PETROLEUM</span></h2>
<h3 id="c17">WHAT IS PETROLEUM AND HOW IS IT FORMED?</h3>
<p>Petroleum is a dark, oily fluid that is irregularly distributed
in sedimentary rocks throughout the world. There are several ideas
about the origin of petroleum. The most widely accepted of these
is that billions of plants and animals lived and died in widespread
seas and their remains decomposed and released fluid, fatty particles.
These were distilled into &ldquo;hydrocarbons&rdquo; (a mixture of the
elements hydrogen and carbon, such as gas and oil).</p>
<h3 id="c18">HOW AND WHERE DID OIL COLLECT IN ROCKS?</h3>
<p>The hydrocarbons, or oil and gas droplets, were buried by
countless tons of sediments that accumulated on ancient sea bottoms.
As these sediments hardened into sedimentary rocks, the
hydrocarbons were squeezed into whatever empty spaces were available
in the rocks. As the layers of sedimentary rocks later became
folded and broken, oil and gas droplets and salt water moved upward
through any interconnecting open spaces. Some droplets escaped
to the surface as &ldquo;seeps,&rdquo; but many were trapped when they came
up against a nonporous barrier. Gas, being lighter than either oil
or water, was trapped at the top, and oil was stopped in the middle,
above the salt water. An accumulation of this kind is termed a
&ldquo;pool&rdquo; or a &ldquo;field.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c19">WHERE DID OIL ACCUMULATE IN ILLINOIS?</h3>
<p>Conditions under which oil is found in Illinois (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>) are
as follows: (a) coral reefs, (b) anticlines (upfolds or arches of rock
layers), (c) &ldquo;pinching&rdquo; or &ldquo;lensing&rdquo; out of dipping, overlapping
porous rock layers, and (d) buried sandstone-filled ancient stream
channels.</p>
<h3 id="c20">ARE THERE LAKES OR RIVERS OF OIL UNDERGROUND?</h3>
<p>No. Oil and gas accumulate in the pores (openings) between
silt and sand grains and in small openings in limestone and
dolomite.</p>

<h3 id="c21">HOW IS OIL DISCOVERED?</h3>
<p>Although prospect (test) drilling is still the only way to prove
the presence or absence of commercial quantities of oil beneath
the surface, careful study by a geologist of all available information
may indicate the most favorable places for testing. Since oil
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
and gas migrate to the highest parts of the porous rock zones, the
geologist tries to find these high places even though they may be
several hundred feet underground. Sometimes dipping rocks can
be seen in outcrops, and several geophysical methods have been
used to indicate where such high places may occur underground. At
other times, high places are found by studying with a microscope
samples of rocks collected from wells already drilled in the surrounding
area. The geologist notes the type and order of the formations
which have been drilled. Many holes have been drilled
based on such information.</p>
<p>Whether or not the test drilling is successful as a producing
well, small samples of cuttings of the rock being drilled
are collected and saved to be studied at a later time. Various instruments
are also put down into the hole to record temperatures,
pressures, electrical properties, and other characteristics of the
rocks. This type of information, when carefully plotted on maps,
serves to locate new areas for test drilling.</p>
<h3 id="c22">HOW MUCH OIL CAN BE OBTAINED FROM AN OIL POOL?</h3>
<p>There is no way to tell before a hole is drilled whether or
not oil will be found, how much oil is present, or what will be the
best way to get it to the surface. Where subsurface pressures are
great enough, oil may flow to the surface.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, about one-third of the oil actually
present in the rocks can be pumped before the well becomes uneconomical
to operate. This is called primary production. Oil
operators have learned that by pumping water or gas down some
wells into the oil-bearing formation, another third of the oil may
be forced out through neighboring wells. This is called secondary
production. Experiments that use steam or that burn some of the
oil underground in an oil-bearing formation are attempts to recover
the remaining third. These methods using heat are often referred
to as tertiary production methods.</p>
<h3 id="c23">WHAT IS THE &ldquo;BIGGEST&rdquo; OIL WELL ON RECORD IN ILLINOIS?</h3>
<p>Illinois&rsquo; largest well, near Centralia, flowed 12,000 barrels
of oil in a 24-hour period. Most Illinois oil wells, however,
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
have to be pumped, and the majority of them are now producing 10
barrels or less a day. The deepest producing well, 5,354 feet,
was drilled in 1960 in Wayne County, near Fairfield. In the same
year the deepest oil test was drilled to a depth of 8,616 feet and
was stopped in granite. This test is located in Fayette County
near Beecher City and has its oil production from a zone over 4,000
feet above the bottom of the hole.</p>
<h3 id="c24">HOW MUCH OIL IS PRODUCED IN ILLINOIS AND HOW VALUABLE IS IT?</h3>
<p>In 1963, about 75 million barrels of oil, 2.7 percent of the
nation&rsquo;s total, were produced in Illinois (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>). This oil is valued
at over $221,000,000.</p>
<h3 id="c25">IS OIL PRODUCTION INCREASING OR DECREASING IN ILLINOIS?</h3>
<p>In 1940, our state had its highest yield of oil when
147,647,000 barrels were produced. Although production figures
remained fairly high for some time, they have declined in the past
few years. Since no new large oil discoveries have been made
recently, Illinois&rsquo; total known oil reserves are decreasing yearly.
In 1963, Illinois ranked eighth among the oil-producing states,
with 420 oil fields consisting of 30,149 wells.</p>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">COAL</span></h2>
<h3 id="c27">WHAT IS COAL AND HOW IS IT FORMED?</h3>
<p>Coal is a combustible rock that was formed by the accumulation
and partial decay of vegetation. When coal was forming
millions of years ago, most of the state was a low coastal plain
bordered on the west and southwest by a shallow sea. A large
variety of plants grew in great swamps which covered this coastal
plain (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>). When the plants died, they accumulated in the
swamps to form thick masses of peat that were eventually covered
by shallow seas and buried beneath mud and sand. Periodically,
the region was above sea level, new swamps developed, new peat
deposits accumulated, and more sediments were laid down. This
process occurred repeatedly until over 3,000 feet of sediments had
been deposited. Then the sediments were slowly compacted and
hardened so that sandstones, shales, limestones, and coals were
formed.</p>

<h3 id="c28">HOW DO WE KNOW THAT COAL WAS DERIVED FROM PLANT MATERIALS?</h3>
<p>Although plant impressions or fossilized wood can be seen
in coal, they are more common in shales and sandstones associated
with the coal. Often roots can be seen in the clay that lies just
under the coal, and in some places stumps of trees from the coal
swamp forest are preserved in the sediments adjacent to the coal
(<a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>). When pieces of coal are examined with a microscope,
carbonized plant remains can be seen.</p>
<h3 id="c29">HOW MANY COAL SEAMS ARE PRESENT IN ILLINOIS?</h3>
<p>There are at least 40 different coal seams in Illinois, but
most are relatively thin. Seven coal seams have been mined extensively,
and all together 20 or more have been mined.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h3 id="c30">HOW IS ILLINOIS COAL MINED?</h3>
<p>In Illinois there are two main ways of mining coal: strip
(open-cut) and underground. Strip or open-cut mines (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>)
usually operate where the coal is at very shallow depths, although
such mining is done as much as 100 feet deep or more in some
places. Many old underground mines produced coal from seams
that were less than 100 feet deep because they did not have the
large machinery for strip mining when these mines were started. An
abandoned mine, 1,004 feet deep, near Assumption is the deepest
underground coal mine in the state. Coal is now being mined at
depths somewhat over 800 feet in Jefferson County.</p>
<h3 id="c31">HOW DOES ILLINOIS RANK AS A COAL PRODUCER?</h3>
<p>Illinois ranks fourth in production of coal in the United
States. It is exceeded only by West Virginia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania.
Some of the largest and most efficient mines in the
country are operated in Illinois. Underground mines in Illinois
have the highest rate of tons mined per man each day in the country,
and this rate is increasing. Increased mining efficiency has
made it possible to hold the price of coal low enough so that it can
successfully compete against other fuels for many uses.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h3 id="c32">HOW MUCH COAL IS PRODUCED IN ILLINOIS ANNUALLY AND HOW VALUABLE IS IT?</h3>
<p>In the last 10 years, an average of about 46 million tons
of coal has been mined each year (<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>). In 1963, approximately
51.6 million tons were produced, which were valued at about
$196,000,000 at the mine. Since 1961, strip mines have produced
over half of the coal mined in Illinois.</p>
<h3 id="c33">HOW LONG WILL OUR COAL SUPPLIES LAST?</h3>
<p>It will take well over 1,000 years at the present rate of
mining in Illinois to exhaust our coal reserves. An estimated 140
billion tons of coal in seams of minable thickness remain in the
ground in our state; these are the largest known reserves of bituminous
coal of any state in the United States.</p>
<h3 id="c34">WHAT IS COAL USED FOR?</h3>
<p>Electric power generation consumes the greater part of the
annual coal production in Illinois. Coal is also used for home and
commercial heating, for production of coke, and for manufacturing
various chemical compounds from coal tar. Products derived from
coal tar include drugs and medicines, plastics, synthetic fibres,
perfumes, flavorings, dyes, synthetic rubbers, explosives, specialized
oils, solvents, wood preservatives, tarlike paving and
roofing materials, and some gas. The gas is both produced and
utilized in the coke industry.</p>
<h3 id="c35">WHAT IS COKE?</h3>
<p>Coke is a material produced by burning coal in the absence
of air so that most of the gases and water are driven off without
consuming the solid portion. The resulting solid coke is a strong,
porous, combustible substance.</p>
<h3 id="c36">HOW IMPORTANT IS COKE AND HOW IS IT USED?</h3>
<p>The structure and nature of coke make it a valuable fuel for
blast furnace use in the production of steel. In the past, most of
the coal used in the manufacture of coke has come from areas of
higher quality coal outside of our state. However, at present,
over 1,000,000 tons of Illinois coal are mined annually for the
production of metallurgical coke.</p>

<h3 id="c38">WHAT TYPES OF STONE ARE PRODUCED IN ILLINOIS?</h3>
<p>Limestone and dolomite are the most abundant rocks quarried
in Illinois. Small amounts of marble, limestone, and sandstone for
building stone are also produced. In addition, some glacial boulders
and cobbles are used for rock gardens and in home construction.
The crushed limestone industry is Illinois&rsquo; most important
rock products industry.</p>
<h3 id="c39">WHAT ARE LIMESTONE AND DOLOMITE?</h3>
<p>Limestone is a sedimentary rock that consists chiefly of
calcite, which is composed of calcium, carbon, and oxygen.
Dolomite is a variety of limestone
that contains considerable magnesium
in addition to the other elements.
Limestones were deposited
on the floors of ancient seas that
repeatedly covered most parts of
Illinois. Shelled creatures, corals,
and coral reefs helped build
up the thick limestone deposits
(figs. <a href="#fig13">13</a> and <a href="#fig14">14</a>).</p>

<h3 id="c40">WHERE ARE LIMESTONE AND DOLOMITE QUARRIES LOCATED IN ILLINOIS?</h3>
<p>Limestone and dolomite
quarries are located along the
southern, western, and northern
margins of the state where the thick
deposits of these rocks crop out at the surface. Although bedrock
was deposited in horizontal layers, it has since been downfolded
into the Illinois Basin whose center is in southeastern Illinois.
Thus, the thick limestones and dolomites that are quarried along
the margins of the state are too deeply buried to be quarried in the
central part of this basin (<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>).</p>

<h3 id="c41">ARE ANY STONE QUARRIES LOCATED IN THE AREA UNDERLAIN BY THE ILLINOIS BASIN?</h3>
<p>Yes. In the area underlain by the basin, stone quarries are
operated in younger, thinner rock strata of Pennsylvanian age.
These strata also overlie the thick limestones and dolomites quarried
along the margins of the state. The quarries located within
the basin area produce stone for agricultural limestone, roads, and
other purposes.</p>
<h3 id="c42">HOW AND WHERE ARE LIMESTONE AND DOLOMITE USED?</h3>
<p>Millions of tons of stone are crushed annually to produce
aggregate for use in making concrete roads and buildings, for road
surfacing, and for agricultural limestone. Agstone is applied to
farmlands to neutralize soil acidity, improve soil structure, add
calcium and magnesium, and promote conditions favorable for the
utilization of soil materials by plants. Large quantities of limestone
are used in making lime and cement. There are three cement plants
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
in northern Illinois&mdash;two at LaSalle and one at Dixon&mdash;and one in
southern Illinois, at Joppa.</p>
<p>Small amounts of stone are used for making alkalies and
glass, for railroad ballast, for building stone, for dusting coal
mines to prevent coal dust explosions, and for ingredients in
mineral feeds for livestock.</p>
<h3 id="c43">HOW MUCH STONE DOES ILLINOIS PRODUCE?</h3>
<p>A production of about 36 million tons of stone in 1963 was
valued at almost $48,000,000. The cement made from Illinois
limestone in the same year was valued at $32,000,000.</p>
<h2 id="c44"><span class="small">CLAY</span></h2>
<h3 id="c45">WHAT IS CLAY AND HOW IS IT FORMED?</h3>
<p>Weathering or alteration of some rocks produces clay
which is a very fine-grained, unconsolidated rock. Clay is made
up of a group of minerals, of which illite, montmorillonite, kaolinite,
and chlorite are the most abundant.</p>
<h3 id="c46">HOW EXTENSIVE ARE CLAY DEPOSITS IN ILLINOIS?</h3>
<p>Clay deposits in Illinois consist of Quaternary clays,
which were deposited by glaciers, lakes, and winds; and of fireclay,
shale, kaolin, and &ldquo;fuller&rsquo;s earth,&rdquo; all of which are bedrock
deposits. Quaternary clay, fireclay, and shale resources
occur widely in very large quantities; &ldquo;fuller&rsquo;s earth&rdquo; and kaolin
deposits are small in relation to other clay resources.</p>
<h3 id="c47">HOW IS ILLINOIS CLAY USED?</h3>
<p>Surface clay, shale, and fireclay are used in the manufacture
of structural clay products, such as brick, drain tile,
and hollow block (<a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>). Fireclay is used for a bonding agent
in molding sand, for the making of stoneware vessels, for a
plaster on the walls of industrial furnaces, and for making
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
refractory brick. Refractory
brick must be able to withstand
very high temperatures
and is used to line industrial
furnaces, boilers, kilns, and
ladles for molten steel.</p>
<p>Shale and clay are
ground up and mixed with
limestone in the manufacture
of cement. Crucibles, refractories,
china, and porcelain
are made from kaolin.
&ldquo;Fuller&rsquo;s earth&rdquo; is used as a
sweeping compound and as an
animal litter.</p>

<h3 id="c48">WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THE CLAY PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED IN ILLINOIS?</h3>
<p>About $53,900,000 worth of clay products were manufactured
in Illinois in 1963.</p>
<h2 id="c49"><span class="small">SAND AND GRAVEL</span></h2>
<h3 id="c50">WHERE DO SAND AND GRAVEL COME FROM?</h3>
<p>Glacial deposits of sand and gravel are the chief source of
these materials in Illinois, but chert or flint gravels that are older
than the glacial deposits are known and utilized locally in western
and extreme southern Illinois. Sands of recent origin are dredged
from deposits in the larger rivers and streams (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>), and commercial
silica sand is produced from sandstone bedrock.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/p12a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="173" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 17&mdash;Dredge equipment used in producing sand and gravel.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h3 id="c51">WHAT IS THE VALUE OF COMMON ILLINOIS SAND AND GRAVEL PRODUCTION?</h3>
<p>Production of common sand and gravel totaled 27,115,000
tons at a value of $24,800,000 in 1963.</p>
<h2 id="c52"><span class="small">SILICA SAND</span></h2>
<h3 id="c53">WHAT IS SILICA SAND?</h3>
<p>Although natural sands are aggregations of many kinds of
small rock and mineral fragments, silica sand consists almost
entirely of fine grains of a single mineral, quartz. The principal
sources of Illinois silica sand are in LaSalle (Ottawa, Utica,
Wedron, and Troy Grove areas) and Ogle (Oregon area) Counties.</p>
<h3 id="c54">HOW IS SILICA SAND USED?</h3>
<p>Silica sand, produced in northern Illinois, is famous for
its high purity, and is widely used in making glass. More than
two-thirds of the raw material in common glass is silica sand.</p>
<p>Quantities of silica sand are used as molding sand, because
it can withstand the high temperatures produced in casting
steel and other metals. It also is used for grinding and smoothing
plate glass, for sand blasting, and for fracturing sand used
to increase the production of oil wells. Some silica sand is ground
to a fine powder and utilized as an ingredient in scouring compounds,
paint fillers, pottery, glazes, and enamels.</p>
<p>A specially sized sand is produced from the St. Peter Sandstone
Formation (Ordovician in age) that is used in testing the
strength of cements and as a laboratory standard in various kinds
of tests.</p>
<h3 id="c55">HOW VALUABLE IS SILICA SAND TO THE ECONOMY OF THE STATE?</h3>
<p>Illinois is a major producer of silica sand, having produced
2,900,000 tons in 1963. The silica sand and ground silica produced
in the same year was valued at $11,400,000.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h2 id="c56"><span class="small">TRIPOLI</span></h2>
<h3 id="c57">WHAT IS TRIPOLI AND WHERE IS IT FOUND?</h3>
<p>Tripoli, also known as amorphous silica, is mined in Alexander
County in southern Illinois. It is prepared for market by
being ground to a fine powder. It consists of tiny particles of
quartz.</p>
<h3 id="c58">WHAT ARE SOME OF THE USES FOR TRIPOLI?</h3>
<p>Tripoli is used as &ldquo;white rouge&rdquo; in optical lens polishing,
as a paint filler, as a fine abrasive, in the ceramic industry, and
for many other purposes.</p>
<h2 id="c59"><span class="small">FLUORSPAR</span></h2>
<h3 id="c60">WHAT IS FLUORSPAR?</h3>
<p>Fluorspar, or fluorite, is a glassy mineral that is commonly
gray, white, or colorless, but may be green, blue, purple, yellow,
or black. It is composed of calcium and fluorine. Fluorite is not
a gem because it is too fragile and soft. Mineral collectors seek
it because it is attractive and because some varieties have the
ability to glow under invisible ultraviolet light (hence the term
&ldquo;fluorescence&rdquo;).</p>
<h3 id="c61">WHERE ARE FLUORSPAR DEPOSITS LOCATED AND HOW IMPORTANT IS ILLINOIS PRODUCTION?</h3>
<p>Fluorspar produced in the United States comes chiefly from
a small area in Illinois and Kentucky where it has been mined
since 1842. Illinois produced about 66 percent of the nation&rsquo;s
total in 1963. The state&rsquo;s production amounted to more than
132,000 tons, valued at about $6,547,000. The crude ore is extracted
from nearly horizontal bedded deposits and from nearly
vertical veins in mines up to 800 feet deep in Pope and Hardin
Counties. Finished fluorspar is produced from the crude ore by
separating and concentrating methods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h3 id="c62">WHAT ARE FLUORSPAR PELLETS?</h3>
<p>In the separation of fluorspar from the other materials with
which it naturally occurs, a process is used that involves grinding
the spar to a very fine powder. The powdered spar has a number
of uses, but to suit it for use as a flux (a substance which
promotes fusion) it is made into pellets by the use of a binder.</p>
<h3 id="c63">WHAT IS FLUORSPAR USED FOR?</h3>
<p>Fluorspar is used extensively as a flux in the steel industry,
but over 50 percent of the spar produced in Illinois in 1963
was consumed in the manufacture of hydrofluoric acid. A large
portion of this acid production is used in the aluminum industry.
Hydrofluoric acid is also employed in the preparation of many
fluorine compounds, particularly those used in the production of
fluorocarbons (refrigerants, plastics, aerosols), insecticides, and
high-energy fuels for rockets and missiles. The fluorocarbons
utilize about 40 percent of the hydrofluoric acid production.</p>
<h2 id="c64"><span class="small">LEAD AND ZINC</span></h2>
<h3 id="c65">WHAT ORES YIELD LEAD AND ZINC IN ILLINOIS?</h3>
<p>The mineral galena is the principal ore of lead. Galena is
gray in color, very heavy, has a bright metallic luster, and breaks
into cubes along steplike cleavage surfaces (<a href="#fig18">fig. 18</a>). It is composed
of lead and sulfur.</p>
<p>The chief ore of zinc is the mineral sphalerite. It may be
brown, yellow, or black. Sphalerite is a combination of zinc and
sulfur, has a resinous luster, and is not as heavy as galena.</p>
<h3 id="c66">WHERE ARE LEAD AND ZINC MINES LOCATED AND HOW LONG HAVE THESE ORES BEEN MINED?</h3>
<p>Although the lead deposits of extreme northwestern Illinois
(now Jo Daviess County) were reported by the French explorers
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
in 1658 and are said to have been worked by the Indians, the influx
of white settlers in the early 1800&rsquo;s marked the beginning of
an extensive mining industry, which was an important factor in the
early development of that part of the state. The town of Galena
takes its name from the mineral galena, which was the principal
ore mined.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig18">
<img src="images/p13.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="761" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 18&mdash;Galena cubes.</p>
</div>
<p>In 1845, the Upper Mississippi Valley produced 60 percent
of all lead mined in the United States, which then ranked first in
world lead production. Until about 1860, the zinc ore was considered
useless, but today its total value is several times that
of lead.</p>
<p>Lead mining began in southern Illinois in 1842. Lead and
zinc production in this area is a by-product of fluorspar mining.</p>
<h3 id="c67">WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THESE METALS PRODUCED IN ILLINOIS?</h3>
<p>In 1963, Illinois produced 20,377 tons of zinc valued at
about $4,677,500 and 2,901 tons of lead worth about $626,600.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c68"><span class="small">GROUND WATER</span></h2>
<h3 id="c69">WHAT IS GROUND WATER?</h3>
<p>Ground water is water that fills all openings in earth materials
in the zone of permanent saturation. The top of the zone of
saturation is called the water table. The source of ground water
is precipitation (rain and snow) that seeps into the soil and percolates
downward. Below the water table, ground water moves
slowly toward places of discharge such as springs, lakes, rivers,
marshes, and wells. Water falls to the ground, moves through
the rocks, returns to the surface, and finally gets back to the atmosphere
by evaporation and from plants (<a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>). This cycle is
continuously repeated.</p>
<h3 id="c70">WHAT KINDS OF ROCKS YIELD GROUND WATER?</h3>
<p>Ground water is most readily obtained from saturated rocks
that have fairly large openings between grains (such as sand,
gravel, and sandstone) or have interconnected cracks or channels
(such as limestones). Rocks that contain ground water and that
will yield it to wells are called aquifers. Sand and gravel beds
are widely used aquifers in Illinois.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h3 id="c71">IS WATER FOUND IN UNDERGROUND LAKES AND RIVERS IN ILLINOIS?</h3>
<p>No. There are a few large springs that flow from rocks
along river bluffs in Illinois, but most ground water occurs in
tiny openings within the rocks. Ground water reservoirs may be
regarded as similar to sponges rather than as underground lakes
or rivers.</p>
<h3 id="c72">WHY DO WELLS SOMETIMES GO DRY?</h3>
<p>The water table rises and falls seasonally and from year
to year, depending upon the amount of precipitation. Sometimes
the water table may fall below the bottom of the well or below the
pump. Sometimes overpumping the well or pumping too many wells
in a small area lowers the water table sufficiently to check the
yield of the well.</p>
<h3 id="c73">WHAT IS AN ARTESIAN WELL?</h3>
<p>An artesian well is one in which pressure forces water to
rise in the well above the level where it was found. In some artesian
wells water flows out at the surface. Conditions for artesian
wells are illustrated in <a href="#fig19">figure 19</a>. The shale above the sandstone
and limestone aquifers in the figure is &ldquo;tight&rdquo; and does not
permit water to escape upward to the level at which it enters the
aquifers in the intake areas. The water is under natural pressure.
When a well is drilled through the shale and into the aquifers,
water rises, seeking its own level. Most of the deep wells in
northern Illinois are artesian wells, though few of them flow at
the surface anymore.</p>
<h3 id="c74">WILL YOU ALWAYS FIND WATER IF YOU GO DEEP ENOUGH?</h3>
<p>This is generally true. However, in much of the southern
two-thirds of Illinois the deeper waters are quite salty. Therefore,
only the upper few hundred feet of rocks are worth exploring for
water. In the northern third of Illinois, where the deepest water
wells are located, fresh water extends in some places to more
than 2,000 feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h3 id="c75">HOW CAN GROUND WATER BE FOUND?</h3>
<p>The most effective way of locating a ground water supply
is by using knowledge of the geology and ground water conditions&mdash;gained
partly from study of existing well records&mdash;to determine
the most favorable areas and depths to drill to.</p>
<p>An additional tool that has been used successfully in Illinois
is the electrical earth resistivity survey. The resistivity
survey attempts to locate buried sand and gravel layers that commonly
are sources of ground water. Test drilling is recommended
at sites that appear to be underlain by sand and gravel.</p>
<p>There is no known method that will positively &ldquo;find&rdquo; ground
water without drilling.</p>
<h2 id="c76"><span class="small">ILLINOIS STATE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY</span></h2>
<h3 id="c77">WHY IS GEOLOGY IMPORTANT?</h3>
<p>Geology and allied sciences are being called upon increasingly
to aid in more intelligent and efficient discovery and utilization
of mineral wealth. Our national life and welfare are more
and more dependent upon the further discovery and proper use of
the earth&rsquo;s natural resources. Illinois is widely recognized by
scientists, industrialists, and educators as being outstanding in
its promotion of research and industrial development.</p>
<h3 id="c78">WHAT ARE SOME OF THE SERVICES AVAILABLE FROM THE SURVEY?</h3>
<p>The occurrence and distribution of rock and mineral deposits
in Illinois are studied by the State Geological Survey Division
of the Department of Registration and Education (<a href="#fig20">fig. 20</a>). In
seeking new information concerning the state&rsquo;s natural mineral resources,
physical and chemical studies of useful rocks, minerals,
and mineral products are made. Techniques and methods are developed
and experiments are conducted to find and prepare Illinois&rsquo;
mineral substances for use.</p>
<p>The results of the Survey&rsquo;s field and laboratory findings
are published and made available to all citizens upon request.
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
Much information that has not been published is in the open files
of the Geological Survey where it may be examined by the public.
Members of the Survey&rsquo;s scientific and technical staff answer requests
for information received by letter, telegram, telephone, or
personal interview.</p>
<p>Since the main ideas of geology are easy to understand
and greatly increase one&rsquo;s enjoyment and appreciation of the world
in which we live, the Geological Survey publishes popular and
educational booklets designed for the use of Illinois teachers and
students. The Survey also distributes a labeled collection of rocks
and minerals for class use in Illinois schools. Six geological
science field trips are conducted each year throughout various sections
of the state for teachers and interested laymen. Members
of the Survey staff give illustrated lectures to organized groups
about the geology and mineral resources of the state.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
